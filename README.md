Abstract
Animal manure is largely seen as annoying waste. Central to this article is the assessment of its waste to value added product potential. The interesting capacity of anaerobic digestion and algal pond integration to profit from manure to energy and fertilizer is examined. The investigation considered three series of animal manures (cattle, swine and poultry varieties). This system proved beneficial and showed vast opportunities. Here, upon evaluation based on 1 ton each of the manure categories, it was found to generate reasonable amount of energy. Using its waste for algae cultivation proves effective as the CO2 is taken care of and utilized as algae feed and the required nutrient can be sourced from within the system. Furthermore, anaerobic digestion of algal biomass was found to be capable of providing additional energy amounting to over a quarter that from any of the crude manure digestion. Overall, the system has surplus nitrogen available. Howbeit, it was found to suffer from intrinsic phosphorous exhaustion, which can be remedied through the supply of fertilizer from outside sources.
